================

Hi, I'm Dmitri Shuralyov, a [person](https://dmitri.shuralyov.com), and this is my backlog of things I want to get to get around to resolving.

If you'd like to contact me, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/shurcooL/backlog/issues/new)! Think of it as another email inbox for me. Everything is public, just like on Twitter. If you have a sensitive issue and would like to reach me privately, feel free to use email for that.

I'll also use it to keep track of personal tasks, but you don't have to mind that.

(This is a little experiment I'm trying, so it may not last. We'll see how it goes.)
